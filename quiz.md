## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a method or procedure of a softwore
development that provides software components services to create or build a 
business application. This is a teachnology that uses a components that can be 
used to develop a new application. In other words, its a technology that can
create other business application or technology. Its a technology that create
another technology by providing a software components.


2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- Standardized Service Contracts
	It is services that stick to its service description.
- Loose Coupling
	It lessen or decrease the dependency of service contract, service
	implementation and service consumer. Its giving more dependecy to the
	client and to the web service.
- Abstraction
	The SOA hides the logic behind the services that they provide.
- Service Reusability
	The logic is being divided into service to reuse the code multiple times.
- Autonomy
	This indicate the full control to the logic that is being hide/encapsulate.
- Statelessness
	The software should not hold one state to other but it should be done 
	by the whole application.
- Discoverability
	The service should be widely discovered by the clients and it can be
	discovered usually in a service registry.
- Composability
	 This is the ability of the service breaking a complex issues/problems
	 into a manageable issues/problems.
- Interoperability
	 The service should use a standards that allows multiple subcribers 
	to use the service.


3. Define Microservices.
- Microservices is used to build a individual application to more agile, scalable
and resilient way.


4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- Independently deployable 
	This service provide a packageable unit for the organization to use
 	to distribute easily.
- Right tool for the job 
	The microservice provides suitable tools to every component of an 
	application that shares common stack, database and data model to do a better 
	tool for the job.
- Precise Scaling 
	In microservice individual service can be deployed/distribute individually.


5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
The Diffrence of SOA and Microservices:
1. Implementation 
SOA provide different services that shared resources while microservice it 
provides the independent and smaller services.

2. Data Storage
SOA shared data storage, the microservices have independent data storage.

3. Deployment 
SOA have a challenging distribution/deployment wherein the full rebuild still needs a small changes. 
The microservices deployment is much easier because it is independent.

4. Reusability 
SOA is reusable because of its shared common resources while 
microservice have its own resources meaning the resources is independent it can be only reuse through API's.

The Similarities of SOA and Microservices:
- In my perspective the similarities of SOA and Microservice are the services that 
  it provides for clients. This services had a huge impact for technology to help 
  the clients achieved their goals and satisfied their ideas.


6. Define Web Services.
- Web service is a type of software that use a standardized messaging.
Where in it use open protocol and standards for exchanging information/data
between applications or softwares.


7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
- Exposing the existing function on the network
	It uses HTTP request to activates its function meaning web services
	basically showing the functionality of codes.
- Interoperability
	It allows the communication between application from one another to share
	certain datas and services.
- Standarized Protocol
	It uses the standard protocol for communication which provide a advantages
	such a wide range of choices, cost and increase of quality.


8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
- XML Based
	The web service used a XML which eliminates or remove any networking system.
- Loosely Coupled
	The consumer is not directly tied to the web services.
-Coarse-Grained
	It provides the a way to access the right part of business logic.
	Meaning it can provide to access the logic that is only needed.
- Ability to be synchronous or asynchronous
	It provides the client to wait or response before completing its operation
	before continuing. While asynchronous allows client to invoke
	service while executing other function. Synchronous provide permission
	before executing, while asynchronous allows othe execution while executing.
- Supports Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)
	It allows the client to use procedures, functions and methods on remote
	objects.
- Supports Document Exchange
	It supports the transparency of exchange documents to make it easy to
	business integration.


9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
- Provider
	The source of the web service and create the availability of service
	for the clients use.

- Requestor
	It handles the client application that needs contact to the web service.

- Broker
	It provides the access to the UDDI.

- Publish
	It is the informants of the broker or the service registry.

- Find
	Requestor informed the broker then it will locate
	a published web service.

- Bind
	The informations from the broker about web service can be used by the requestor
	to invoked or use the web service.


10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
- SOAP
 	It use a XML-based protocol for exchanging information between computers
	and application. It is a platform and langusge independent and it also
	allows server fire walls.
- WSDL
	 It is used to describe the web services and how it can be access.
- UDDI
	It use for describing, publishing and finding web services.
